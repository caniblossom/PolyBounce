A simple 2D physics demo / small game.

The goal of this project is to implement a simple physics engine for convex two dimensional polygons and a small game implementing that engine. 

The goal of the game is to guide a simple polygon through a environment made out of other polygons. The challenge is that the environment will disintegrate as a result of player action (and gravity), as the player tries to leverage it to reach the goal.

### Engine targets
- simple vector and matrix arithmetic
- convex 2D objects
- rigid body physics
- proper friction (optional)

### Game targets
- one pre-made game level 
- controls with rolling and jumping
- simple GUI for resetting / quitting the game
- rendered with OpenGL using LWJGL
