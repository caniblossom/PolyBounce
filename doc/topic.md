A simple 2D physics demo / small game.

The goal of this project is to implement a simple physics engine for convex two dimensional polygons and a small game implementing that engine. 

The goal of the game is to guide a simple polygon through a environment made out of other polygons. The challenge is that the environment will disintegrate as a result of player action (and gravity), as the player tries to leverage it to reach the goal.
